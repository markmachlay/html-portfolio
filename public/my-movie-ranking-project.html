    </p>
<H3>American Beauty</H3>
    <p>
        Intially only liked it because of Thora Birch but its also a tragic tale that for some reason, made me feel sorry for suburnanites.

<H3>The Mask</H3>
    <p>
        The only Jim Carrey movie my father likes and just a feel good comedy showcasing Carrey in the perfect kind of role for his humor.

<H3>Mrs. Doubtfire</H3>
    <p>
        Basically just a feel good family comdedy with Robin Williams doing his finest work.
